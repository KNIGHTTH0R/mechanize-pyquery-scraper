A web scrapper built using mechnaize & pyquery to extract content from sulekha.com containing information about Indian Restaurants in Chicago.
Yeah, I am a "fan" of the "windy city", but I still like the Indian cuisine; so I will make myself an excel file with an exhaustive restaurant list 
of Indian restaurants in Chicago the cool and simple way.

- mechanize used as a web browser emulator to fetch data
- pyquery used to parse a page and extract relevant content
- xlwt is used to write into an excel file
