A web scrapper built using mechnaize, pyquery to extract content from sulekha.com containing information about Indian Restaurants in Chicago.
(Yeah that's one of my favourite city, but I still want Indian food when I am there) :)

- mechnize used as a web browser emulator to fetch data
- pyquery used to parse a page and extract relevant content
- xlwt is used to write into an excel file
- pygeocoder to convert an address into a latitude and longitude
